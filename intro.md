# Preface

The limitation of designing all kinds of vehicles and machines has been soly material, machanical, and manufacturing until we realize that climate change and pollution become a significant issue. Take jet engines for example, initially was considered as impossible because no material can withstand the high temperature of the combustion. Some machanical engineers overcame this issue by inventing the turbine cooling and using of ceramic coating composites. However, the temperature inevitably produce high NOx which is a major air pollutant for all kind of combustion engine. Therefore, the modern civilian aircraft jet engine use technologies such as rich-burn quick-quech lean burn (RQL) to reduce the harmful gas.
